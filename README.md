# livetest3

Create a simple website for a fictional cafe with two pages:

A home page and a menu page.

The home page should include a welcome message and a button to navigate to the menu page.
The menu page should display a list of items available at the cafe, each item with a clickable element (e.g., a button or a link). When a user clicks on an item, display a simple alert message with the item name.
